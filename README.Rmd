## Overview

The goal of `histonePTM` is to make histone PTM analysis less tedious by offering a whole workflow analysis or functions that help build a workflow based on whatever software you are using.

Not only this, other functions allow retreiving data from the internet, manipulate `mgf` files, visualize results in addition to some quality control assessments.

Some functions rely heavily on other functions from well-established packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of histonePTM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remote")
remote::install_github("HijaziHassan/histonePTM")
```
## Contributing

Any contribution is very welcomed. The first version is more adapted to `Proline` software output. But it tried to generalize each function to be generic and very flexible to be applicable for other software outputs. 

## Getting help

If you encouter any bug, a problem, a weired behavior, or have a feature request, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/HijaziHassan/histonePTM/issues).

If you would like to discuss questions related to histone analysis using mass spectrometry, please open a discussion here [discussion](https://github.com/HijaziHassan/histonePTM/discussions)

## Workflows
### Analysis of DDA results using `analyzeHistone()`

If you are using [`Proline`](https://www.profiproteomics.fr/proline/)
 software to validate identifications resulted from search engines such as `Mascot`, the function `analyzeHistone()` can:

 * **Isolate** histone peptides based on user-defined histone protein(s).
 * **Normalize** intensities to the total area or intensity within peptide families or total filttered peptides.
 * **Abbreviate** histone peptides
 * **Rename** PTMs
 * **Calculate** coefficients of variations
 * **Remove** and **store** duplications
 * **Mark** with (**\***) and **store** identifications where the software assigns the same peak apex (i.e. same intensities) to isobaric positional isomers (i.e. K18acK23un and K18unK23ac) which nearly co-elute. 
 * **Filter** unwanted and/or identifications that are -more often than not- false positives (e.g. H3 K37mod). 
 * **Filter** some identifications if they are not quantified in a user-defined number of samples. 
 
 This results in 3 Excel file:
 
 * **File 1**: Containing the raw data with sheets. Sheet 1 contains raw data of isolated histone peptides without any transformation of data. The rest of the sheets are filtered data from the first sheet original data. E.g. Only N-terminally labeled peptides.
 
 * **File(s) 2**: Peptide-centric. An excel file per histone protein with each sheet containing identifications from same peptide.
 
 * **File 3**: PTM-centric. An excel file summarizing PTMs with each sheet containing identifications with specific PTM.
 
 All this with flexibility to:
 
 - choose only to analyze (and output results) of user-defined histone protein (e.g. only `H3`).
 - filter identification with cut-off threshold of missing values.
 - output **File(s) 2** with either removing all unlabeled `me1`, `K37mod` (for H3K27R40 peptide) or both.
 - group **File(s) 2** into one file or save each protein results in a separate file. 
 
**Pre-requisites**

* `Proline` excel output file containing the sheets:

 + `Best PSM from protein sets` which includes identification and their intensities in each sample. This assumes that IDs with multiple charge states are already summed using post-processing functionality inside `Proline`.
 
 + `Search settings and infos` which includes information about `RAW` files' names and their corresponding search result files' names.
 
* An excel file containing at least two columns:

  + `SampleName`: custom samples names
  + `file`: names of `RAW` files.
other optional columns: `Condition`, `BioReplicate`, and/or `TechReplicate` depending on the experimental design.

Some functions used to build-up this workflow among others are shown below:

```{r analyze DDA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(histonePTM)

# analyzeHistone(analysisfile, # file name
#                 metafile, #metafile name
#                 hist_prot= c('All','H3', 'H4', 'H2A', 'H2B'), #choose one these options
#                 labeling = c("PA", "TMA", "PIC_PA", "none") # allow reversing labeling when renaming PTMs
#                 NA_threshold, #numeric #optional
#                 norm_method = c('peptide_family', 'peptide_total'),
#                 extra_filter = c("none", 'no_me1', "K37un", "no_me1_K37un"), #optional
#                 output_result= c('single', 'multiple'), #optional
               

```

### Learn with Fun

Go histonic and get random quotes about histones from the literature!

```{r litRicher}

litRicher()

```

... or do your own literature from Pubmed!

```{r pubmed literature review, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages('rentrez')
library(rentrez)
litReview(start = 2023, 
          end = 2024 , 
          db = "pubmed",
          term = "Histone lactylation",
          save_file = FALSE)
#A list with two tables
    # 1 - Articles titles with their year of publication
    # 2 - number of publication per year

```

scrape MS-identified PTMs from Uniprot

```{r Uniprot-PTMs}

ptm_Uniprot(Uniprot_accession = 'P62805', #H4_HUMAN
            save_file = FALSE)

```
