\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataframe in long format with at least 4 columns: Intensity, PTM, sequence (or sequence label) and Condition. check the arguemnts below.
A 5th column can be provided to be the plot title.}

\item{x_axis}{x variable (PTM column)}

\item{y_axis}{y variable (intensity column). If already values are percentage, set \code{scale} to 1.}

\item{condition}{The condition column (WT vs disease, concentration, ...)}

\item{id_col}{unique ID column such as sequence or sequence label}

\item{plot_title}{(\code{optional})A column with values to be the plot_title (optional).}

\item{fun}{median (\code{default}) or mean. This will be the height of the bar.}

\item{error_type}{one of "CI" (confidence interval), "SE" (standard error), "SD" (standard deviation).}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level (e.g. 0.9, 0.5, 0.99, etc...)}

\item{scale}{100 (\code{default}). If you want to keep values as they are use 1. No other values are allowed.}

\item{cond_order}{(optional). A character vector containing conditions according to which bars will be ordered in the plot.}

\item{save_plot}{(\code{logical}; \code{optional})}
}
\value{
A dataframe grouped by `id_col` (and `plot_title` if passed) with a nested list-column harboring the generated bar plots
(representing either `mean` or `median`) with jitter points (corresponding to individual measurements per `condition`).
}
\description{
Individual measurements will be plotted as data points. Their median (or mean) will be represented as a bar. Each bar will be colored according to the condition.
}
